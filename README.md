# KH:BBS Command Melding Quick-Reference Guide

## Info

This simple command-line program takes info about Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep's command melding system from noz3r0's faq and puts it in an easy to search format to make grinding a bit easier and more time-efficient. I made this program back when I was teaching myself how to program so I'm aware that the documentation and implementation are garbage.  I'm leaving it as is so I can laugh at myself in the future. As such, this program has attained the 'Works on my Machine' badge of honor. I make no promises about it working anywhere else.
